# useful-commands
A mind-map containing a collection of useful command-line interface commands that I use on my daily routine.

# Summary

## TL:DR

The view-only version of the mind-map, which is hosted on GitMind, can be accessed through this [link](https://gitmind.com/app/doc/c9d1960991).

The pdf version, which is available on this repository, is available [here]().

The png version, which is also available on this repository, is available [here]().

The GitMind version (internals), and a text version of it (it is quite readable, in fact), are also available on this repository.

As soon as GitHub implements embedded PDF rendering, or improved tools for rendering large pictures (otherwise it will not be feasible for someone to see the entire mind-map), I will make sure to update the README to automatically show the document(s). 

For any contributions or feedback, feel free to contact [me](brunoeckdema@gmail.com) (see [Contributing](#Contributing)).

## Features

### Current

* Mind-map organized into main categories of commands, which are represented according to their O.S applicability and usage.
* Current categories of commands contemplated are:
  * Networking: configuration related to internet interfaces, IP, DNS, communication/transmission, and so on.
  * Filesystem: operations on files and folders.
  * Processes: creation and inspection of processes.
  * Firewall: settings related to network security.
  * Versioning: usage of popular code versioning/hosting platforms.
  * Build-essentials: nomenclature taken from the associated Ubuntu `apt` package, contains commands related to programming in general, like compilation, debugging, and other utilities.
  * Package manager: commands used by popular package managers.
  * Web: functionalities associated with web requests and general HTTP/HTTPS comunication.
  * Certificates: security certificates' creation and manipulation.
  * Services: information and managing functions for common system services.
  * Windows Update: commands associated with Windows Update, like installing new updates or checking already installed ones.
  * Active Directory: commands and utilities used for managing domain controllers and LDAP.

### Future

* Maybe add some documentation for each branch, like references for further reading? I though about adding specfic documentation for each command (like the output of `--help` flags), but that obviously would lead to maintance problems.

## Mind mapping

This repository contains a mind-map that I developed for storing useful CLI (command-line interface) commands that are really helpful on my daily routine. These commands are likely to be useful for other developers/programmers around the internet, therefore I decided to create a collaborative project for the map. 

A mind map is a diagram used to visually organize information, showing relationships among pieces of the whole [[1]]. After discovering them through a book called "[Mind Mapping: Improve Memory, Concentration, Communication, Organization, Creativity, and Time Management]", by [Kam Knight], I decided to see for myself how this tool could be useful for me, since I had good experiences with another learning tool in the past few months - Spaced Repetition [[2]]. 

I am very skeptical of "miraculous" methods or frameworks, since sometimes they are sold as universal solutions, when in practice they work in a very personal level, what can lead people to disappointment, or unoptimal usage of them. In my case, I verified that, **for me**, mind-mapping is very useful for one niche: *documenting stuff that I periodically need, but always end up forgetting*. Organizing this list of commands in levels, and separating them by colors, really helps me visualizing what I need in a fast manner, and also makes it fun to work on it (this is quite vital in all projects).

## GitMind

[GitMind] is an open-source web platform for mind-mapping and flowcharting in general. Considering its features, and how ease it is to kick things off, I consider this the best open-source tool for mind-mapping available. This mind-map is stored on the GitMind's cloud, where I have the rigths to edit it. 

For security reasons, I can not share editting rights with others, since I do not have the means to back up previous versions of the map, in case of cathastrophic failures. **This is why I ask for anyone who wants to collabote with it, to contact me with the proposed changes, so I can apply them myself to the map. Appropriate credits will be given to the contribution's author, which I will pin at the [bottom](#Contributors) of this README section.**

## The mind-map itself

This mind-map was elaborated considering a developer's daily routine - specifically, mine. Since I usually mess with the C's and its associated tools (normal, #, and ++), and also a bit with system configuration, the initial version contains mostly commands associated with these aspects. This is why I actively ask for contributions: I do not master all aspects of system administration to know all the usual commands and sintaxes for them.

For sanity reasons, I categorized the commands into three labels: Windows, Linux, and cross-platform (cross-command-line?). Since Powershell supersedes the command-prompt in many ways (not always though), I have chosen to adopt it as the default inteface for Windows platforms. The fact that Powershell is marching towards cross-platform usage also helps. For Linux, I have chosen my favorite distribution to test and document the commands: Ubuntu. There are a plethora of distros availables, and all of them have their unique quirks. If necessary, I will adapt the mind-map to discriminate between specific distros. However, I believe that this is not a main issue, nor something that should be a main aspect of this initiative. 

# Contributing

As I mentioned before, **feel free to share more useful commands that can be added here, and also any feedback towards making this tool better (improve branching, visuals, etc).** There will be things that I will not be able to do, since I am limited by GitMind's framework, but that does not mean that I can not migrate to some improved platform, *as long as the migration is guaranteed to provide improvements.*

This project, just as pretty much all of my other projects, have the base principle of "in the worst case, it will be useful for me". That does not mean though that I do not want to make it useful for others... it just means that I need you help to achieve that :)

# About Me

Even though I have been messing with coding in general since I was 15, my first actual experiences with programming were between 2011 - 2017, while I was graduating in Chemical Engineering. Most of these experiences were related to engineering tools like [Aspen Plus], [COMSOL], [Matlab], Fortran, VBA and C++. In 2018, I started working with Operations Reasearch, focusing on mathematical models designed for the optimization of integrated logistic systems. Most of my work in this area is related to algorithm development using CLI C/C++ apps. During this period, I also worked as a full-stack developer in a [Outsystems] based project. More recently, I started working as a software developer, where I deal on a daily basis with C# development (.NET Framework, .NET Core), C/C++ (Win32), CMake, SQL, network management, and so many other recurring tools in the world of development. I also have a pet project called [FlashMEMO], which is a learning platform based on Flashcards and the [Spaced Repetition] memorization method. All these personal projects have the goal of extending my knowledge of programming tools, and also to learn and apply the most recent architecture and coding guidelines.
